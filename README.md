Problem Statement:
The goal of this project is to recommend personalized learning paths for students based on their performance and learning behaviors. Specifically, we aim to predict whether a student will complete a course or not based on factors such as study hours, prior knowledge, learning methods, and motivation. This problem is crucial for educational platforms seeking to optimize student engagement and outcomes by tailoring learning interventions to individual needs.

Techniques Used:
Causal Bayesian Networks:

We employed Causal Bayesian Networks to model the relationships between various learning-related factors (such as hours studied, prior knowledge, learning method, and motivation) and course completion.
Causal inference techniques were used to understand how different interventions (e.g., study methods, hours studied) impact the likelihood of course completion.
Logistic Regression for Classification:

A logistic regression model was trained to predict course completion (binary classification: completion vs. non-completion).
We used categorical features (e.g., learning method) and transformed them into dummy variables to fit the logistic regression model.
Cross-Validation:

We performed 5-fold cross-validation to ensure that the model generalizes well across different subsets of the data.
Model Evaluation:

We evaluated the model's performance using a range of metrics:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
AUC-ROC
We also visualized the confusion matrix to understand the classification performance (true positives, false positives, etc.).
Calibration Curve:

A calibration curve was used to evaluate how well the predicted probabilities match the true outcomes (whether the student actually completed the course or not).
Results:
The model achieved a mean cross-validation accuracy of 0.688 (around 69%), indicating that the model is reasonably effective at predicting whether a student will complete the course based on the input features.
The model performed well in terms of precision and recall, though there is still room for improvement, especially in distinguishing between students who complete the course and those who do not.
Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy: The model correctly predicted the outcome for 69% of the test samples.
Precision: The model's ability to correctly predict students who complete the course was evaluated with precision.
Recall: The recall score indicates how well the model identifies all students who completed the course.
F1-Score: The F1-score provides a balance between precision and recall, showing how well the model handles both false positives and false negatives.
AUC-ROC: The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) helps assess the model's ability to discriminate between the two classes (completion vs. non-completion).
Confusion Matrix: Visualized the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions to understand the model's performance in detail.
Conclusion:
The project successfully built a predictive model for course completion using Causal Bayesian Networks and logistic regression.
The model's accuracy of 69% is a solid starting point, but there are opportunities for improvement through more complex algorithms, better feature engineering, and tuning hyperparameters.
The use of evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC) and the calibration curve provides a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance, making it ready for potential deployment in educational platforms to recommend personalized learning paths.
